 * See the spec on the website for tips and example behavior.
 *
 * Also note: you may want to use private helper methods to help you solve these problems.
 * YOU MUST MAKE THE PRIVATE HELPER METHODS STATIC, or else your code will not compile.
 * This happens for reasons that aren't the focus of this assignment and are mostly skimmed over in
 * 142 and 143. If you want to know more, you can ask on the discussion board or at office hours.
 *
 * REMEMBER THE FOLLOWING RESTRICTIONS:
 * - do not call any methods on the `IntTree` objects
 * - do not construct new `IntTreeNode` objects (though you may have as many `IntTreeNode` variables
 *      as you like).
 * - do not construct any external data structures such as arrays, queues, lists, etc.
 * - do not mutate the `data` field of any node; instead, change the tree only by modifying
 *      links between nodes.
